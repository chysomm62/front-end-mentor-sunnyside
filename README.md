## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- I built Desktop view first, I wont do it again :sad:

### What I learned

I learnt about CSS grid in this project. Infact, this is the very first time I am trying out CSS grid. I love it and will surely go for it in future projects

### Continued development

Maybe in the future, I might wanna add the other pages and maybe build this with REACT

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.mozilla.org) - This helped me throughout the project. I really liked the css grid and flex explanations and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google.com) - I just googled my way out of this one :haha:.
